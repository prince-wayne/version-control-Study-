# Study Notes
We seen a few commands today, might've forgot a few, but hopefully we get a full enough reveiw to note them all properly.

It's important to know that we are using git bash instead of the command line or powershell due to a weird inconsistency I seen eariler. Which could be due to my own argorance
11:00 AM - just studying a little before mother gets here
during this session the lady explains push, pull, and cloning, which I believe we've (me & myself) done in the past.  
git init creates a new repository, must navigate to a dir which you wish to become one. 
git remote won't work on this new repo because it is not yet public/only exsist on the local machine
git remote -v <- a strong need to review, 

So, the remote thing was confusing because we didn't realize we couldn't fully use the line to make a repository. It seems the correct way to perform what was seen in the video is to initizate (git init) a repository on the local machine, add files if desired, Stage & commit, go to github then handle the remote side, then use remote add origin <link> to link the local to the remote. 
**But** there is a lot easier way to handle this and this is seen as an - if I can't use the internet or new local version control before publishing (public or private visablily) then I should do this - (using - as double qoutes due to typing format). 

11:45 AM - Push and Pull
Push takes you changes to the top level (your current branch), Pull brings others changes (or your other devices) to your local device or repostory. 
1:09 PM - still waiting for mother, a breif interuption, but we learned that we could use git log (-oneline) to review our latest interactions at the branch / commit level. 

**Above is from August 12, 2025**

there's a chance I lost a file, I legit can't remember if I had more notes 8/14/2025
We will likely write in a format or structure soon to change
8/14/2025 - Waking up and studying again at desmond house.
